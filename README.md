## Getting started 🚀

The instructions below will allow you to get a copy of this project running in your computer for development and tests purposes.

## Requirements 📋

* Basic knowledge of NodeJs projects
* Advanced knowledge in Typescript/Javascript language
* Have NodeJs installed in the local machine that we are going to use

## Installation 🔧

First of all, we will clone the repository using the command prompt:

git clone https://github.com/cunba/toteco_backend_node.git
```

Then we will need to install the modules that we are using in the project that are defined in the package.json:

```
npm install
```

## Usage 📦

We can launch the application using one of these commands:

```
npm start
or
npx ts-node src/main.ts
```

_Note: to make secured requests to the Api we will need the certifications, you can ask any member of the project to provide them to you or make your own certficates._

After seeing the message that the Api is running in port X we can go to the host provided in the config (or to localhost if not provided) and make requests using swagger.
